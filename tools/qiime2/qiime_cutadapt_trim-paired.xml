Find and remove adapters in demultiplexed paired-end sequences.
###############################################################

Search demultiplexed paired-end sequences for adapters and remove them. The
parameter descriptions in this method are adapted from the official
cutadapt docs - please see those docs at https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io
for complete details.

Parameters
----------
demultiplexed_sequences : SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]
    The paired-end sequences to be trimmed.
adapter_f : List[Str], optional
    Sequence of an adapter ligated to the 3' end. The adapter and any
    subsequent bases are trimmed. If a `$` is appended, the adapter is only
    found if it is at the end of the read. Search in forward read. If your
    sequence of interest is "framed" by a 5' and a 3' adapter, use this
    parameter to define a "linked" primer - see
    https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io for complete details.
front_f : List[Str], optional
    Sequence of an adapter ligated to the 5' end. The adapter and any
    preceding bases are trimmed. Partial matches at the 5' end are allowed.
    If a `^` character is prepended, the adapter is only found if it is at
    the beginning of the read. Search in forward read.
anywhere_f : List[Str], optional
    Sequence of an adapter that may be ligated to the 5' or 3' end. Both
    types of matches as described under `adapter` and `front` are allowed.
    If the first base of the read is part of the match, the behavior is as
    with `front`, otherwise as with `adapter`. This option is mostly for
    rescuing failed library preparations - do not use if you know which end
    your adapter was ligated to. Search in forward read.
adapter_r : List[Str], optional
    Sequence of an adapter ligated to the 3' end. The adapter and any
    subsequent bases are trimmed. If a `$` is appended, the adapter is only
    found if it is at the end of the read. Search in reverse read. If your
    sequence of interest is "framed" by a 5' and a 3' adapter, use this
    parameter to define a "linked" primer - see
    https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io for complete details.
front_r : List[Str], optional
    Sequence of an adapter ligated to the 5' end. The adapter and any
    preceding bases are trimmed. Partial matches at the 5' end are allowed.
    If a `^` character is prepended, the adapter is only found if it is at
    the beginning of the read. Search in reverse read.
anywhere_r : List[Str], optional
    Sequence of an adapter that may be ligated to the 5' or 3' end. Both
    types of matches as described under `adapter` and `front` are allowed.
    If the first base of the read is part of the match, the behavior is as
    with `front`, otherwise as with `adapter`. This option is mostly for
    rescuing failed library preparations - do not use if you know which end
    your adapter was ligated to. Search in reverse read.
error_rate : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True), optional
    Maximum allowed error rate.
indels : Bool, optional
    Allow insertions or deletions of bases when matching adapters.
times : Int % Range(1, None), optional
    Remove multiple occurrences of an adapter if it is repeated, up to
    `times` times.
overlap : Int % Range(1, None), optional
    Require at least `overlap` bases of overlap between read and adapter
    for an adapter to be found.
match_read_wildcards : Bool, optional
    Interpret IUPAC wildcards (e.g., N) in reads.
match_adapter_wildcards : Bool, optional
    Interpret IUPAC wildcards (e.g., N) in adapters.
minimum_length : Int % Range(1, None), optional
    Discard reads shorter than specified value. Note, the cutadapt default
    of 0 has been overridden, because that value produces empty sequence
    records.
discard_untrimmed : Bool, optional
    Discard reads in which no adapter was found.

Returns
-------
trimmed_sequences : SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]
    The resulting trimmed sequences.
