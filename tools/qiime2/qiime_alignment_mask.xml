Positional conservation and gap filtering.
##########################################

Mask (i.e., filter) unconserved and highly gapped columns from an
alignment. Default min_conservation was chosen to reproduce the mask
presented in Lane (1991).

Parameters
----------
alignment : FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
    The alignment to be masked.
max_gap_frequency : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True), optional
    The maximum relative frequency of gap characters in a column for the
    column to be retained. This relative frequency must be a number between
    0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive), where 0.0 retains only those columns without
    gap characters, and 1.0 retains all columns regardless of gap character
    frequency.
min_conservation : Float % Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True), optional
    The minimum relative frequency of at least one non-gap character in a
    column for that column to be retained. This relative frequency must be
    a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). For example, if a value of
    0.4 is provided, a column will only be retained if it contains at least
    one character that is present in at least 40% of the sequences.

Returns
-------
masked_alignment : FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
    The masked alignment.
